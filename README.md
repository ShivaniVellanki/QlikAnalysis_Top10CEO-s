# QlikAnalysis_Top10CEO-s
Qlik analysis of top 10 CEOs showcases financials, education, and industry impact in a dashboard, offering clear visual insights into leadership success factors.

The project delivers an in-depth Qlik analysis of the top 10 CEOs, exploring their financial performance, educational background, age versus net worth correlation, and the industries they influence. This comprehensive Qlik dashboard analysis aims to provide insights into the characteristics that define successful leadership within major sectors, including healthcare, conglomerates, and the oil and gas industry. The input for this project is a rich dataset comprising detailed information on each CEO's financial outcomes, qualifications, age, net worth, and their respective industries. The analysis seeks to uncover patterns and trends that contribute to the CEOs' achievements, offering a clear visualization of their impact on their companies and industries at large.

The output of the analysis is a multifaceted Qlik dashboard that presents a visual representation of the CEOs' financial performance through bar charts, their educational backgrounds via bar graphs, and a line graph illustrating the relationship between age and net worth. Additionally, a pie chart demonstrates the diversity of industries these leaders represent. Through this detailed Qlik visualization, the project identifies key findings such as the prevalent attainment of MBAs among these executives, the correlation between age and increased net worth, and a balanced industry representation. This analysis not only highlights the varied paths to executive success but also serves as a benchmarking tool for understanding the attributes and trends that correlate with achieving prominence in leadership roles.
